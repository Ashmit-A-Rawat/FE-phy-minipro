I created this webpage with a navigation bar, a hero section to introduce the app, a statistics section displaying metrics like downloads and active users, and a testimonial section for motivation. 
The design is styled using Tailwind CSS. Iâ€™ve included buttons for joining study rooms, displayed platform statistics, and added a contact form for inquiries. 
It also features contact details like an email address and social media icons. The goal is to encourage users to register and interact with the platform.
